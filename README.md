# Audio Tone Analysis and Translation Pipeline
-Developed a machine learning pipeline to process video files, extract voice tone, and perform language translations from English to Hindi.

-Extracted audio from video files using MoviePy library. 

-Utilized Google's speech recognition and translation APIs for transcription and translation tasks. 

-Generated translated audio files using the gTTS library.

-Integrated translated audio into the original video using MoviePy's editing capabilities.

Technologies Used: Python, MoviePy, pyAudioAnalysis, Googletrans, SpeechRecognition, gTTS

Outcome: Successfully created a pipeline capable of extracting audio from videos, analyzing voice tone, translating content from English to Hindi, and integrating translated audio back into the original video. This project showcases proficiency in audio processing, natural language processing, and video editing, highlighting adaptability in utilizing diverse libraries and APIs for multimedia data manipulation.
